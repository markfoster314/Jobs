            A. Information you provide to JOB$
JOB$ collects certain personally identifiable information about you, including information that is reasonably capable of being associated with you (“Information”). Examples of Information that JOB$ collects include but are not limited to:
Contact Information. This may include your first and last name, postal address, telephone number, and email address.
Billing Data, including your payment instrument number (such as a credit or debit card number), expiration date, and security code as necessary to process your payments.
Identity Information. If you are a Service Provider, we may collect Personal Information, such as your date of birth and address, national identification number if applicable, together with the result of basic criminal record checks as provided by you, or by our Third Party Agents (as defined below), as applicable and to the extent permitted by law in your jurisdiction, and to validate your identity.
Financial Information. To help Service Providers set up a payment account and help Clients make payments to Service Providers and pay fees to JOB$, we may collect financial information, including credit card number, bank routing numbers, tax information, taxpayer identification number, and other payment information, as applicable. We use Financial Information in order to operate the JOB$ Platform and to ensure that Service Providers are paid by Clients. We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing our platform and services and to fulfill our contracts with Users. To keep your financial data secure, we have contracted with a third party to maintain and process your payment card information.
Promotional Information. Certain offerings of the JOB$ Platform, such as newsletters, surveys, contests, and the like are optional and so you are not required to enter them or to give us your data in connection with them. Where you do consent to take advantage of JOB$ Platform offerings, we will use your data to (as applicable) send you newsletters and other communications that are tailored based on information we have about you, or to operate and manage the survey, contest or similar offering in connection with our legitimate interest in promoting our business and the JOB$ Platform. To opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, please see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.
Content Information. You also may choose to send JOB$ Personal Information in an email or chat message containing inquiries about the JOB$ Platform and we use this Information in order to help us respond to your inquiry. We also collect content within any messages you exchange with other Users through the Service (such as through our chat functionality), and we will never use or share such information for marketing purposes.
We require that you furnish your Contact Information and Financial Information when you register an account with us in order to provide services through the JOB$ Platform. For example, if you are a Client, we collect your first and last name, email address, and the college you attend in order to create and administer your JOB$ account. We also collect additional information in order to facilitate your booking request, such as information about the job you are seeking, the time, date and location of the job, and Financial Information. If you are a Service Provider, we collect your first and last name, email address, and the college you attend in order to create and administer your JOB$ account and facilitate communications between you and your Clients through the Platform. We also collect information about your jobs, rates, and skills, as well as Identity Information and Financial Information.
Third Party Information. If you registered through a co-branded version of our JOB$ Platform through one of our Partners (as defined below), they may provide us with basic information such as your name, address, email, and purchase history related to your Job needs. We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, Financial Information, or fraud detection information, from Third Party Agents (as defined below) and combine it with other information that we have about you, to the extent permitted by law, in order to comply with our legal obligations and for the legitimate interest in improving the JOB$ Platform. JOB$ may work with Third Party Agents to perform identity checks, criminal background checks, and right to work checks on Service Providers, if applicable and permitted by local law, in order to advance our legitimate interests in ensuring the safety of our Users and maintaining the integrity of the JOB$ Platform.

We will not share your current location obtained in this manner with other Users.
We also use various Tracking Technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) to automatically collect information when you use the JOB$ Platform, including the following:

Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Platform. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings. We utilize persistent cookies that only JOB$ can read and use, and access mobile device IDs to:
    • save your login information for future logins to the JOB$ Platform;
    • assist in processing items during checkout;
    • hold session information; and
    • track user preferences.
Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our website and expire when you close your browser. We utilize session ID cookies and similar technologies to:
    • enable certain features of the JOB$ Platform;
    • better understand how you interact with the Sites and the JOB$ Platform;
    • monitor usage by our Users and web traffic routing on the JOB$ Platform;
    • track the number of entries in JOB$ promotions, sweepstakes and contests; and
    • identify visited areas of the JOB$ Platform.
Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the JOB$ Platform and then close your browser.
Exhibit A sets out the different categories of cookies that the JOB$ Platform uses and why we use them.
We may work with third party advertisers who may also place or read persistent cookies on your browser, and we may use Flash cookies (or local shared objects) to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on the Sites to personalize your visit.
You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you will not be able to use all portions or all functionalities of the JOB$ Platform.

Interest-Based Advertising. Ads are a standard part of user experience on the Internet, and JOB$ believes that targeted advertising enhances this experience. JOB$ and affiliate third parties may use cookies and other technologies to place ads where they believe interested Users will see them. In addition to banner ads, JOB$ may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide. We may incorporate Tracking Technologies into our own Service (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services. Some of these Tracking Technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (“Interest-Based Advertising”).
For more information and to understand your choices regarding third party ads, please see the “Cookies and Other Technologies and Interest-Based Advertising” in Exhibit A. Advertising and marketing is carried out as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.
Analytics and Market Analysis. JOB$ may analyze information (“Market Analysis”) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, and promoting and growing the JOB$ Platform.
JOB$ uses information to offer services to Users who express an interest in these services, through a poll for example, or to Users who can be presumed to have an interest based on results from our Market Analysis. We do this as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing an engaging and relevant experience, promoting our services, and growing our business.

            We only share the Information we collect about you as described in this Privacy Policy or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:
Third Party Agents. We share information, including Identity Information, with entities that process information on our behalf for our business purposes. Third Party Agents assist us with services such as payment processing, data analytics, marketing and advertising, website hosting, fraud prevention and detection, communication services, and technical support. We contractually prohibit our Third Party Agents from retaining, using, or disclosing information about you for any purposes other than performing the services for us, although we may permit them to use information that does not identify you (including information that has been aggregated or de-identified) for any purpose except as prohibited by applicable law.
To operate the JOB$ Platform, including processing your transactions, we may share your information with our agents, representatives, vendors and service providers (“Third Party Agents”) so they can provide us with support services as follows:
    • Email origination;
    • Identity checks, to the extent permitted by applicable law;
    • Fraud detection. Our fraud detection providers will use information relating to you and your use of and activity on the JOB$ Platform to provide fraud detection services to their other clients;
    • Receipt, invoice, or support services;
    • Customer relationship management services;
    • Financial transaction fulfillment and related chargeback and collection services; and
    • To otherwise help us provide the JOB$ Platform.
Partners. Some JOB$ content is "sponsored by" or "presented by" other companies. If you connect to the JOB$ Platform through a co-branded version of our JOB$ Platform or otherwise participate in one of our partner programs, we may share information about your use of the JOB$ Platform with that Partner in order to offer the integrated platform and to evaluate the partner program. We may also share your information with our Partners in order to receive additional information about you, or in order to create offers that may be of interest to you. Please check such Partner’s privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don't want these Partners to have your Personal Information, you can choose to not participate.
Promotions. When you voluntarily enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, we share information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners’ list). By entering a promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your name, voice, and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials. We may occasionally contact you, if you want us to, with information about special events, activities, promotions, contests, submission opportunities, and programs. You always have the ability, in your Account, to ask JOB$ not to contact you with this type of information. Please see the Your Rights and Choices section for more information.
Other Users. JOB$ facilitates contact between Clients and Service Providers and reserves the right to share a Service Provider’s contact information (e.g. name, phone number, email, or postal address) with a Client and vice versa, or with their legal or other representative, in order to facilitate: (1) the resolution of a dispute related to or arising from an interaction between two or more Users of the JOB$ Platform; or (2) the performance of a Job. This exchange of information is a mandatory part of the JOB$ Platform.
Legal Obligations. JOB$ and our Third Party Agents may disclose information or User Generated Content, including location data or communication data, to a third party if required or permitted to do so by law or pursuant to a court order, warrant or subpoena. JOB$ reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Site(s) and the JOB$ Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or JOB$ or its partners, parents or affiliates.
It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).
Merger or Acquisition. JOB$ reserves the right to share information in connect with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.
Public Areas. Your profile on the JOB$ Platform consists of information about you, and may include information such as photographs, skills and expertise, feedback/rating information, and other information, including your username (“Profile”). The information in your User Profile may be visible to all Users and the general public. If you choose to post a Job via the JOB$ Platform, the contents of such listing will be viewable to Service Providers you select on the JOB$ Platform.

            You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us and our Partners, remove your information from our database, choose to not receive future promotional communications related to the JOB$ Platform, or cancel your account by contacting us.
Account Settings. During registration you choose whether to receive marketing correspondence from JOB$ and its affiliates and Partners. This information remains on your Profile where you can, at any point, easily edit it. After logging on, click on the “Notifications” tab to make your preferred selections.
Push Notifications. You have the option to receive updates and relevant offers via push notifications in your app. These notifications can be configured in the settings of your mobile device.
Corrections to Profile. You have the right to access, update, and correct inaccuracies in your JOB$ Profile at any time by logging in and clicking on the “Profile” tab. There, you can view, update, and correct your Account information. Our databases automatically update any information you edit in your Profile under the “Profile” tab.
So that we may protect the integrity of the JOB$ Platform, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. 
Promotional Communications. You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from JOB$ sent via email by clicking on the unsubscribe link in any message. You can opt out of receiving promotional communications from JOB$ sent via text message at any time by following the instructions provided in those messages to text the word "STOP". Please note that your opt-out is limited to the phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, JOB$ may continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, Jobs, transactions, servicing, or JOB$’s ongoing business relationship with you. 
Cookies and Pixels. Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
Do Not Track. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operations should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com.
App and Location Technologies. You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you. If you do not want us to use your location anymore for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your device’s account settings, your mobile phone settings, and/or within the mobile application.
