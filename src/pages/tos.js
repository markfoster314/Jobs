          <div style={{ paddingTop: '10px' }}>
            <p className="text-muted">
            The JOB$ Platform is an app-based two-sided marketplace which enables connections between Clients and Service Providers. “Clients” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to obtain short-term services (“Jobs”) from Service Providers and are therefore clients of Service Providers, and “Service Providers” are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Jobs for Clients. Clients and Service Providers together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”  If you agree on the terms of a Service Provider with another User, you and such other User form a Service Agreement directly between the two of you as set forth in more detail in Section 3 below.
SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE INDIVIDUALS AND INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS. SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OF CLIENTS AND NOT EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURERS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR FRANCHISEES OF JOB$. JOB$ DOES NOT PERFORM JOBS AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS TO PERFORM JOBS. BY CONNECTING PEOPLE AND INDIVIDUALS AND/OR BUSINESSES SEEKING SERVICES WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS, JOBS OPERATES AS AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE THAT CONNECTS CLIENTS WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO WISH TO PERFORM A VARIETY OF JOBS.
USERS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JOB$ DOES NOT SUPERVISE, SCOPE, DIRECT, CONTROL OR MONITOR A SERVICE PROVIDER’S WORK AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR THE WORK PERFORMED AND THE JOBS IN ANY MANNER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, STATUTE, ORDINANCE, REGULATION, OR CODE.
Any reference on the JOB$ Platform to a Service Provider being licensed or credentialed in some manner, or "badged," “reliable,” “reliability rate,” “elite,” “great value,” “vetted” (or similar language) designations indicates only that the Service Provider has completed a relevant account registration process or met certain criteria and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by JOB$ of such Service Provider’s skills or qualifications or whether they are licensed, insured, trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for Clients to evaluate when they make their own decisions about the identity and suitability of Service Providers whom they select, interact, or contract with via the JOB$ Platform.
The JOB$ Platform enables connections between Users for the fulfillment of Jobs. JOB$ is not responsible for the performance or communications of Users, nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Jobs, Service Providers, or Clients, nor of the integrity, responsibility, competence, qualifications, or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users, or of any ratings or reviews provided by Users with respect to each other. JOB$ makes no warranties or representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Jobs requested or services provided by, or the communications of or between, Users identified through the JOB$ Platform, whether in public or private, via on- or off-line interactions, or otherwise howsoever.

            Service Providers may be subject to a review process before they can register for and during their use of the JOB$ Platform, which may include but is not limited to identity verification and criminal background checks, using third party services as appropriate ( “Background Checks” ). Although JOB$ may perform Background Checks, JOB$ cannot confirm that any User is who they claim to be, and JOB$ cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of Background Check information.
When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety, data, and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know. JOB$ will not be liable for any false or misleading statements made by Users of the JOB$ Platform.
NEITHER JOB$, NOR ITS PARENTS, AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, AGENTS, INVESTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, ATTORNEYS, REPRESENTATIVES, INSURERS, EMPLOYEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “AFFILIATES” ) IS RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT, ACTS, OR OMISSIONS, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE JOB$ PLATFORM AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU HEREBY RELEASE JOB$ AND AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, OR DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE JOB$ PLATFORM.

    • You will fulfill the commitments you make to other Users, communicate clearly and promptly through the chat thread, be present and/or available at the time you agree upon with your Service Provider or Client as the case may be, and only utilize the third party payment service provider specified or approved by JOB$ to make or receive payment for services provided through the JOB$ Platform ( the “PSP” );

            You acknowledge and agree that a legally binding contract with another User (the “Service Agreement”) is formed when you and that User agree on the terms of a Job. The terms of the Service Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms proposed and accepted on the JOB$ Platform, and any other contractual terms accepted by both the Service Provider and their Client to the extent such terms do not conflict with the terms in this Agreement, including this Section 3, and do not expand JOB$’s obligations or restrict JOB$’s rights under this Agreement. JOB$ is not a party to any Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any circumstances, create an employment or other service relationship between JOB$ and the Service Provider, nor will it create an employment relationship between the Client and the Service Provider. Users do not have authority to enter into written or oral — whether implied or express — contracts on behalf of JOB$.
While using the JOB$ Platform, Clients, in their sole discretion, determine whether they will be present or not when a Job is performed. Clients agree that if someone other than them books the Job on their behalf or is present in their stead when the Job is performed, they are appointing that person as their agent (“Client’s Agent”) and the Service Provider may take and follow direction from the Client’s Agent as if such direction was given from the Client him- or herself. If you are a Client’s Agent and accessing and using the JOB$ Platform on behalf of a Client, you represent that you have the authority to act as their agent and to bind that person as the principal to all provisions of the Terms of Service. Client’s Agent may authorize any applicable waiver of the Client’s scoping, direction, or instruction of the Service Provider’s work or performance of the Job in the Client’s stead. Client agrees that such direction and/or waiver is valid against Client and Client’s Agent, and Client shall be responsible and liable for all such direction and/or waiver as if made by Client him or herself. Client assumes full and sole responsibility for the acts and omissions of Client’s Agents. 
The Client shall pay their Service Provider(s) in full for all Job services via the PSP as indicated on the JOB$ Platform, at the rates agreed to by the parties in the Service Agreement. Each User agrees to comply with the Service Agreement and this Agreement during the engagement, performance and completion of a Job.

            Users of the JOB$ Platform contract for Jobs directly with other Users. JOB$ will not be a party to any contracts for Jobs or services. Client, and not JOB$, is responsible for payment for all Job services through the JOB$ Platform.  Such payment must be made via the PSP.  JOB$ is not obligated to compensate Service Providers for Client’s failure to pay for services.
The Job Payment and Transaction fee must be paid through the PSP.  Clients on the JOB$ Platform will be required to provide their payment method details to JOB$ and the PSP. Service Providers are responsible for accurately invoicing their Clients within 24 hours of the work being performed, even if the Job is not completed in its entirety or is designated as “ongoing”. Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice(s) for each Job (the “Invoice(s)”), which will include (a) the pricing terms of the Job provided by the Service Provider and agreed upon by the parties (“Job Payment”), (b) any out of pocket expenses agreed upon by the parties and submitted by the Service Provider in connection with the Job,  (c) the transaction fee JOB$ assesses to the Client for access to and information regarding Service Providers, or (d) cancellation charges, if applicable. In addition, a tip or gratuity, as applicable, may be added by the Client or at the Client’s direction to the Invoice(s), and all such tips or gratuities shall go directly to the Service Provider. 
Service Providers will be required to set up an account with the PSP, which may require any or all of the following: registration with the PSP, consent to the terms of service of the PSP, and completion of a vetting process and/or account validation at the request of the PSP. By accepting these Terms of Service, each Service Provider agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to, the PSP Services Agreement (the “PSP Services Agreement”). Please note that JOB$ is not a party to the PSP Services Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Services Agreement are the parties to the PSP Services Agreement and that JOB$ has no obligations, responsibility or liability to any Service Provider or other party under the PSP Services Agreement.
To help prevent fraud and safeguard User information from the risk of unauthorized access, JOB$ and/or the PSP may validate an account before activation and prior to each booking. As part of the validation process, temporary charges may be placed on the account associated with the User and then refunded within 1-5 business days.   This temporary charge may vary depending on the estimated value of the Job and expenses.
When Client receives confirmation through the JOB$ Platform or via email that a Job has been completed, Client automatically authorizes the PSP to process the Invoice(s). Clients may be billed a one-hour cancellation charge as damages at the Service Provider’s hourly rate through the PSP if you book a Job but cancel it before the scheduled time for performance.
JOB$ reserves the right (but not the obligation) upon request from Client or Service Provider, or upon notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or other misuse of the JOB$ Platform, to place on hold any Job Payment, out of pocket expenses, and/or tip or gratuity (if applicable), or refund or provide credits, or arrange for the PSP to do so.
Users of the JOB$ Platform may be liable for any taxes or similar charges required to be collected and/or paid on the Jobs and/or fees provided under the Agreement.

            JOB$ may from time to time provide certain promotional opportunities and contests to Users. All such promotions will be run at the sole discretion of JOB$, and can be implemented, modified, or removed at any time by JOB$ without advance notification. The liability of JOB$ and Affiliates, as well as any of JOB$’s corporate partners pursuant to such promotional opportunities and contests, shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 17 of these Terms of Service.
JOB$ gift cards (“Gift Cards”) and promotional codes (“Promo Codes”) may be available and can be used to pay Job Payments and the JOB$ transaction fee but may not be used to pay for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses or tips or gratuity associated with a Job provided through the JOB$ Platform.
A. Promo Codes
Promo Codes are an offer by JOB$ to reduce the amount a Client has to pay in relation to a Job Payment and transaction fee. Promo Codes will not affect the amount of the Job Payment a Service Provider ultimately receives. The use or application of any Promo Code is solely intended as a promotional initiative and does not in any way create a relationship or engagement between JOB$ or the Service Provider or Client, or constitute wages, fees or other amounts paid to the Service Provider. You agree that you will use Promo Codes in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the Promo Code. A new user Promo Code may only be used once per User, regardless of the email address used during registration. JOB$ reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or benefits obtained through the use of a Promo Code by you or any other User in the event that the use or redemption of a Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or otherwise in violation of the applicable Promo Code terms and conditions or this Agreement.
B. Gift Cards
Gift cards can only be used in connection with Jobs performed on the JOB$ Platform, are not replaceable if lost or stolen, and have no expiration date. Gift cards have no cash value and cannot be exchanged for cash except as required by law. Gift Cards must be entered directly into the Client account; they may not be directly accepted by Service Providers as a payment method.
A Gift Card cannot be combined with any other Gift Cards, gift certificates or Promo Codes. No credit card, credit line, overdraft protection, or deposit account is associated with your Gift Card. You cannot “reload” (or add value/balance) to your Gift Card at this time. If a Gift Card holder’s purchase exceeds the amount of that Gift Card’s balance, the Gift Card holder must pay the difference by another means. Unused Gift Card balances are not transferable. JOB$ reserves the right to correct the balance of a Gift Card if JOB$ believes that a billing error has occurred. JOB$ reserves the right to limit quantities of Gift Cards purchased by any person or entity, and to cancel a Gift Card if it believes that the Gift Card was obtained through fraudulent or unauthorized means. Gift Cards and their use are subject to this Agreement and use of a Gift Card constitutes acceptance thereof.
You agree to comply with all Gift Card terms and conditions.

You are solely responsible for User Generated Content, and we act merely as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Generated Content. You acknowledge and agree that JOB$ is not involved in the creation, development of User Generated Content, disclaims any responsibility for User Generated Content, and cannot be liable for claims arising out of or relating to User Generated Content. Further, you acknowledge and agree that JOB$ has no obligation to monitor or review User Generated Content, but reserves the right to limit or remove User Generated Content if it is not compliant with the terms of this Agreement.
You hereby represent and warrant to JOB$ that your User Generated Content (a) will not be false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; (b) will not be fraudulent or involve the transfer or sale of illegal, counterfeit or stolen items; (c) will not infringe on any third party’s privacy, or copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right or rights of publicity or personality; (d) will not violate any law, statute, ordinance, code, or regulation (including without limitation those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, incitement of hatred or false or misleading advertising, anti-spam or privacy); (e) will not be defamatory, libelous, malicious, threatening, or harassing; (f) will not be obscene or contain pornography (including but not limited to child pornography) or be harmful to minors; (g) will not contain any viruses, scripts such as Trojan Horses, SQL injections, worms, time bombs, corrupt files, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information; (h) will not claim or suggest in any way that you are employed or directly engaged by or affiliated with JOB$ or otherwise purport to act as a representative or agent of JOB$; and (i) will not create liability for JOB$ or cause JOB$ to lose (in whole or in part) the services of its Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or other partners or suppliers.
The JOB$ Platform hosts User Generated Content relating to reviews and ratings of specific Service Providers (“Feedback”). Feedback is such User’s opinion and not the opinion of JOB$ and has not been verified or approved by JOB$. You agree that JOB$ is not responsible or liable for any Feedback or other User Generated Content. JOB$ encourages each User to give objective, constructive and honest Feedback about the other Users with whom they have transacted. JOB$ is not obligated to investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability or to consider any statements or materials posted or submitted by Users about any Feedback but may do so at its discretion. You agree that Feedback enables Users to post and other Users to read about Users’ expression of their experiences and that you will not complain or take any action merely because you happen to disagree with such Feedback. Each Client should undertake their own research prior to booking to be satisfied that a specific Service Provider has the right qualifications for a Job.
JOB$ respects the personal and other rights of others and expects Users to do the same. JOB$ is entitled to identify a User to other Users or to third parties who claim that their rights have been infringed by User Generated Content submitted by that User, so that they may attempt to resolve the claim directly.
If a User believes, in good faith, that any User Generated Content provided on or in connection with the JOB$ Platform is objectionable or infringes any of its rights or the rights of others (e.g. counterfeiting, insult, invasion of privacy), the User is encouraged to notify JOB$. If a User discovers that User Generated Content promotes crimes against humanity, incites hatred and/or violence, or concerns child pornography, the User must notify JOB$.

            JOB$ operates as an online marketplace that connects Clients with Service Providers who wish to perform a variety of Jobs. JOB$ does not perform Jobs and does not employ people to perform Jobs. Service Providers operate as individuals and are customarily engaged in an individual of the same nature as that involved in the services performed for Clients through the JOB$ Platform. JOB$ does not control or direct the Service Providers’ performance of their services or set their work locations, work hours, or terms of work. Service Providers provide services under their own name, and not under JOB$’s name. Service Providers provide their own tools and supplies to perform their services; JOB$ does not provide the tools or supplies. Service Providers are free to maintain a clientele without any restrictions from JOB$ and are free to offer and provide their services elsewhere, including through competing platforms. Service Providers are free to accept or reject Clients and contracts. Service Providers are not penalized for rejecting Clients or contracts, though if Service Providers accept a Client or contract through the JOB$ Platform, they are expected to fulfill their contractual obligations to their client. Service Providers set their own rates for services performed in the JOB$ general marketplace, without deduction by JOB$.
The JOB$ Platform is not an employment agency service or business and JOB$ is not an employer of any User. Service Providers acknowledge and confirm that they are responsible for exercising their own business judgment in entering into Service Agreements and performing Jobs and that, depending on how they exercise such business judgment, there is a chance for individual profit or loss.

                Failure by JOB$ to enforce any provision(s) of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and JOB$ with respect to its subject matter and supersedes and governs any and all prior agreements or communications except as otherwise specified in the Arbitration Agreement in Section 28A. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be interpreted in a manner which makes them valid, legal, and enforceable. Except for the “Agreement Prohibiting Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” provision in the section applicable to U.S. Residents in Section 28A below, in the event any provision is found to be partially or wholly invalid, illegal or unenforceable, (1) such provision shall be modified or restructured to the extent and in the manner necessary to render it valid, legal, and enforceable or, (2) if such provision cannot be so modified or restructured, it shall be excised from the Agreement without affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we may assign or transfer this Agreement without your consent, including but not limited to assignments: (i) to a parent or subsidiary, (ii) to an acquirer of assets, or (iii) to any other successor or acquirer.

This Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by you without our prior written approval. Any assignment in violation of this Section 21 shall be null and void.

            Service Providers alone are responsible for identifying and obtaining any required licenses, permits, or registrations before offering services and undertaking Jobs. Indeed, certain types of Jobs and services may be prohibited altogether, and it is the responsibility of Service Providers to avoid such prohibited Jobs and services. Penalties may include fines or other law enforcement. If you have questions about how national/ state/ provincial/ territorial and local laws apply to your Jobs and services on the JOB$ Platform, you should first seek appropriate legal guidance.
Because JOB$ does not supervise, scope, direct, control, or monitor a Service Provider’s work or performance of Jobs, Clients must determine for themselves whether a Service Provider has the skills and qualifications necessary to perform the specific Job at hand. Clients may wish to consult their national/state/provincial/territorial or local requirements to determine whether certain Jobs are required to be performed by a licensed or otherwise registered professional. Clients may also wish to discuss with their Service Provider any specific hazards, obstacles, or impediments in the Job location (both visible and concealed) that may impact the performance of the Job.

I. Dispute Resolution - Arbitration Agreement
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND GOVERNS HOW YOU AND JOB$ CAN BRING CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS SECTION WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION, REQUIRE YOU AND JOB$ TO SUBMIT CLAIMS TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE, WITHOUT LIMITATION OR QUALIFICATION, TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU ACCEPT ALL OF ITS TERMS.
(a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE SPEEDY, ECONOMICAL, AND IMPARTIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND JOB$ MUTUALLY AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A COURT OF LAW BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AS SET FORTH HEREIN.
This agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and survives the termination of this Agreement and your relationship with JOB$.
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and JOB$ agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims (“collectively, “Claim” or “Claims”) relating to, arising from or regarding your use of the JOB$ Platform, your relationship with JOB$, Jobs, or this Agreement (including previous versions), including Claims by JOB$, Claims against JOB$ and Claims against JOB$’s Affiliates (including its parent company).
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, this includes, but is not limited to, claims related to payments, any city, county, state or federal wage and hour law, compensation, meal or rest breaks, expense reimbursement, wrongful termination, discrimination, harassment, retaliation, fraud, defamation, trade secrets, unfair competition, personal injury, property damage or loss, emotional distress, any promotions or offers made by JOB$; breach of any express or implied contract or breach of any express or implied covenant; claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws; claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; claims arising under the Fair Labor Standards Act, Civil Rights Act, Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (except for individual claims for employee benefits under any benefit plan sponsored by JOB$ and covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or funded by insurance), and state or local statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters; and all other federal, state or local statutory and common law claims.
If there is a dispute about the arbitrability of any claim (including about the formation, scope, applicability, interpretation, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement), you and JOB$ agree that this threshold dispute shall be resolved by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND JOB$ ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS, UNLESS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ARBITRATION OF EVERY CLAIM OR DISPUTE THAT CAN LAWFULLY BE ARBITRATED, EXCEPT THOSE CLAIMS AND DISPUTES THAT, BY THE TERMS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, ARE EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO ARBITRATE.
(b) Prohibition of Class Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and JOB$ agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Claim between JOB$ (and/or, if applicable, its Affiliates) and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND JOB$ ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (“Class Action Waiver”). Further, unless both you and JOB$ otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any Claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Class Action Waiver shall not apply to California Private Attorney General Act Claims, which are addressed separately below.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. In any case in which: (i) the Claim is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (ii) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Claims, then those Claims shall be severed from any remaining Claims and may remain in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.
(c) Representative PAGA Waiver
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, to the fullest extent allowed by law: (1) you and JOB$ agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the California Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”), California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under PAGA, both you and JOB$ agree that any such Claim shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, “Representative PAGA Waiver”).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this representative PAGA Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative private attorneys general act Claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims, the parties agree that court litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.
(d) Rules and Logistics Governing Arbitration
In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) must be provided to the other party. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the AAA Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated and modified by the terms set forth in this Agreement, and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org  or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if requested by you and if proper based on the facts and circumstances of the Claims presented, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select a different set of AAA Rules. You and JOB$ agree that the arbitration shall be administered before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree within 30 days after names of potential arbitrators have been proposed, then by a single arbitrator who is chosen by the AAA.
As part of the arbitration, the parties will have the opportunity for reasonable discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim(s). The arbitrator may award any individualized remedies that would be available in court. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claims. The arbitrator will provide a reasoned written statement of the arbitrator’s decision, which shall explain the award given and the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based.
The arbitrator will decide the substance of all Claims in accordance with applicable law and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules) subject to the following modifications:
(i) If JOB$ initiates arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, JOB$ will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees.
(ii) If a Client or Service Provider files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages does not exceed USD $10,000, JOB$ will pay all AAA filing and arbitration fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
(iii) If a Client or Service Provider files a Claim in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement and the associated claim for damages exceeds USD $10,000, JOB$ shall pay all costs unique to arbitration (as compared to the costs of adjudicating the same claims before a court), including the regular and customary arbitration fees and expenses, and the Client or Service Provider shall be responsible for contributing up to an amount equal to the filing fee that would be paid to initiate the claim in the court of general jurisdiction in the state in which the Job was performed, unless a lower fee amount would be owed by you as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules. Any dispute as to whether a cost is unique to arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitrator. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of your claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), however, then the allocation of fees will be governed by the applicable AAA Rules.
(iv) Except as required by law or the applicable AAA Rules, each party shall pay its own attorneys’ fees and pay any costs that are not unique to the arbitration (i.e., costs that each party would incur if the Claim(s) were litigated in a court, such as costs to subpoena witnesses and/or documents, take depositions and purchase deposition transcripts, copy documents, etc.).
(v) At the conclusion of any arbitration, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees and costs or any portion thereof to the prevailing party, to the extent authorized by applicable law or the applicable AAA Rules.
Unless you and JOB$ agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings with a Service Provider will take place in the county of the Service Provider’s billing address, and any arbitration hearings with a Client will take place in the county in which the Client received Job services. If AAA arbitration is unavailable in your county, the arbitration hearings will take place in the nearest available location for a AAA arbitration.
(e) Exceptions to Arbitration
The Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims:
    • Claims for workers’ compensation, disability insurance and unemployment insurance benefits;
    • Small claims actions that are within the scope of small claims court jurisdiction and brought on an individual basis;
    • Applications for provisional remedies, preliminary injunctions, and temporary restraining orders relating to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights;
    • Representative action brought on behalf of others under PAGA or other private attorney general acts, to the extent the representative PAGA Waiver in Section 19(d) is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction under applicable law not preempted by the FAA; and
    • Claims that may not be subject to arbitration as a matter of generally applicable law not preempted by the FAA.
Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or a similar local, state or federal agency, and nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party’s obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. This Agreement and Arbitration Agreement do not prevent you from participating in an investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Agreement and do not prevent you from receiving an award for information provided to any government agencies.
(f) Severability
In addition to the severability provisions in subsections (b) and (c), in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable under applicable law not preempted by the FAA, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.
(g) Opt Out of Arbitration Agreement
For Service Providers, you may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate if you have not previously agreed to an arbitration provision in JOB$’s Terms of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision, you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made by this version of the arbitration agreement in the manner specified below, but opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with JOB$.
Except as specified in this arbitration agreement, if you are a Service Provider, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by notifying JOB$ in writing within 30 days of your agreement to these Terms of Service. To opt out, you must send a signed written notification on the JOB$ Platform. 
(h) Service Provider Claims in Pending Class Action
If you are a member of a putative class in a wage and hour class action lawsuit against JOB$ that is pending as of the effective date of these Terms of Service (a “Pending Class Action”), then this Arbitration Agreement shall not apply to your claims in that particular class action. Instead, your claims in that Pending Class Action shall continue to be governed by the arbitration provisions contained in the applicable Agreement that you accepted prior to this Agreement’s effective date.
II. Worker Classification and Withholdings
JOB$ does not employ Service Providers. JOB$ is not responsible for and will not be liable for workers’ compensation or any tax payments or withholding, including but not limited to unemployment or employment insurance, social security, disability insurance or any other applicable federal or state withholdings in connection with a User’s use of the JOB$ Platform. Each User assumes all liability for proper classification of such User’s workers based on applicable legal guidelines.
III. Media and User Generated Content
To the extent permitted by law, you hereby grant JOB$ a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid, unrestricted, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), transferable right to exercise all copyrights, publicity rights, and any other rights you have in (1) your User Generated Content and (2) any videotape, film, recording, photograph, voice, or any instrumental, musical, or other sound effects you provide to JOB$ (collectively, “Media”) in exchange for use of the JOB$ Platform, in any media now known or not currently known in order to market, operate, and improve upon the JOB$ Platform, including but not limited to the right to the following:
    • Use, view, copy, adapt, modify, distribute, license, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast, access, view, and otherwise exploit such Media or User Generated Content;
    • Exhibit, distribute, display, transmit, and broadcast on any and all media (including, without limitation, the internet), any Media or User Generated Content (or portion thereof) or any videotape, film, recording, or photograph (or portion thereof) that such User provides to JOB$ or that JOB$ takes of User, and use, reproduce, modify, or creative derivatives of such User Generated Content or Media, including such User’s picture, silhouette and other reproductions of their physical likeness (as the same may appear in any still camera photograph and/or motion picture film or video) (collectively the “Physical Likeness”) in any format and through any distribution channels;
    • Reproduce in any and all media any recordings of such User’s voice, and any related instrumental, musical, or other sound effects (collectively, the “Voice”), made in connection with the JOB$ Platform or any JOB$ promotional campaigns;
    • Use, and permit to be used, such User’s User Generated Content, Media, Physical Likeness and Voice in the advertising, marketing, and/or publicizing of the JOB$ Platform in any media, in any format and through any distribution channels; and
    • Use, and permit to be used, such User’s name and identity in connection with the JOB$ Platform or any JOB$ promotional campaigns.
Further, you hereby waive any and all moral rights in connection with the Media (to the extent allowable by law in the country where the Job is performed). Each User warrants and represents that they have the lawful authority to grant the rights set out above, and that such rights do not negatively impact any third party rights.
Each User acknowledges that JOB$ shall not owe any financial or other remuneration for using the User Generated Content, Media, Physical Likeness, or Voice provided hereunder by such User, either for initial or subsequent transmission or playback.
Each User hereby waives all rights and releases JOB$ and Affiliates from, and shall hold harmless against any such parties for, any claim or cause of action, whether now known or unknown, including without limitation, for defamation, malicious falsehood, invasion of right to privacy, data protection, publicity or personality or any similar matter, or based upon or relating to the use and exploitation of such User’s identity, User Generated Content, Physical Likeness, Media, or Voice in connection with the JOB$ Platform.
IV. Background Checks
If a Service Provider, you agree to promptly disclose to JOB$ in writing if you have any potentially relevant criminal convictions (other than minor fixed penalty parking or speeding offenses), that arise during your use of the JOB$ Platform.
V. Gift Cards
You agree that you will comply with all Gift Card terms and conditions. In certain U.S. states, after a period of time, JOB$ may remit the cash associated with unused Gift Card balances to the state pursuant to that state’s abandoned property laws. Once JOB$ has remitted such cash to a state, the Gift Card may no longer be redeemed and JOB$ may direct the Gift Card holder to that state’s government instead. Gift Cards have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash except in the following twelve U.S. states where it is required by law to the extent noted below. If you are a resident of one of these U.S. states, and the balance on your Gift Card is less than the respective dollar amount below, you may redeem it for cash:
    California less than $10

    • Connecticut less than $3
    • Maine less than $5
    • Massachusetts less than 10% original value remaining
    • Montana less than $5

VI. Sales Tax Collection and Remittance
In jurisdictions where JOB$ facilitates the collection and/or remittance of sales tax on behalf of Service Providers, you instruct and authorize JOB$ to collect taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant tax authority. You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right to cease the collection and remittance of sales taxes in a particular jurisdiction as permitted by law. You should consult with your own tax advisor to ensure your compliance with all applicable tax reporting requirements.
VII. Release
TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, YOU HEREBY WAIVE THE PROTECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE § 1542, WHICH READS AS FOLLOWS:
“A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.”
If you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any statute, regulation, or common law principle similar to Section 1542 that governs your rights in the jurisdiction of your residence.
Further, in consideration of the services provided by JOB$, you hereby release JOB$ from any and all claims, causes of action, lawsuits, injuries, damages, losses, liabilities or other harms resulting from or relating to telephone calls or text messages, including without limitation any claims, causes of action, or lawsuits based on any alleged violations of the law (including, without limitation, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, Truth in Caller ID Act, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or any similar state and local acts or statutes, and any federal or state tort or consumer protection laws).
